# IP-Discovery-Python-CyberSec-Course

DISCLAIMER
-------------------
There's a mix of lenguages in this project because the course that I took was actually in spanish, so be ready for una mezcla de ambos lenguajes. Y si sumamos python, serian tres lenguajes distintos.
-------------------

This is an excersice for a ethical hacking course. This time, I used the help of ChatGPT to build it up, since I'm new to AI and not so experienced with python I took this chance to, not only learn about cyber security, but also how AI works and researching python is allways good.

I have to say that it was a long process and ChatGPT 3 is not that clever some times, but we made it work.
